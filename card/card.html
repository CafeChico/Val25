					I just want you to know that no matter what challenge the world gave to us. I'd always choose the best option that would allow me to be always by your side. We've already come various problems and challenges. We've promised so many things and I'll always work myself to fulfill that. On my end, I'd start to put care to myself and have a better confidence. I won't back down now that you insist and supported me. I just hope that when things aren't good on your side you'd talk about it, just like how you weren't in favor of my 1-2am sleep. I apologize as always for the times that my mind goes through everything. I would also like to thank you for always keeping me appreciated, I hope you'd be more free and won't hold yourself back when it comes to us, together. Be it for problems, anything. Another thank you for those small acts of love you do, I'd always cherish it and hope for more hehe. Just like this song you've sang on JCI foundation week, I hope that our love will never end, we belong together, always and forever. And when it comes to our own struggle and let me be part of it, so I can help you, call my name and I'll be there, ALWAYS. I also wish you'd be more sweet or something HAHA! This time I'd value that more and won't take advantage on it, I've learned not to get tempt. Again, Happy Valentine's Day! Let's enjoy this day together, Love youu :>
